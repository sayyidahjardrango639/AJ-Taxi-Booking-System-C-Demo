🚖 **AJ Taxi Booking System App** (C Program)

A **human-centric, interactive taxi booking application** built using **C programming**, simulating the way a real staff member would assist a 
customer.
Unlike traditional taxi apps, this system focuses on **personalized guidance**, explaining features, pricing, and options clearly for each user.

5. User selects **car type**: Regular 🚗 or Premium 🚙
6. Displays **available car models with features** 💧📰💊💻
7. Calculates **total fare**: Base price + distance price 🧮
8. Displays **booking summary**: destination, car, features, total fare, estimated arrival ⏱
9. Ends with **reassuring message**: "Your car will arrive in 20 minutes 🚖"

## ⚙ Development Note

This project was created as part of my learning journey. The **idea, features, and vision** were designed by me.

I did not build 100% from scratch instead, I worked together with my **AI companion (Drango 639)**. He guided me with a base sample code and technical
suggestions, while I modified, upgraded, and added my own vision.

So this project is truly **co-created (Human + AI)** with my creativity + Drango 639's coding support.

This reflects my long-term approach: not just coding alone, but **collaborating with AI** to build human-to-human style applications and innovative
solutions.
